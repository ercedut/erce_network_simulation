Network Simulation Project

This project is a network simulation tool designed to simulate nodes, their connections, and message passing between them. It demonstrates core networking concepts, including routing and communication in a controlled environment. The project is built using `.NET` and C#.

Features
- Simulates network nodes and their interconnections.
- Allows message passing between nodes.
- Provides a simulation manager to configure and run the network.
- Demonstrates networking principles in a simplified framework.
